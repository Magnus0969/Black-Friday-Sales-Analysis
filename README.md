# Black Friday Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Black Friday sales data to uncover trends, customer behavior, and product insights. Using Python and various data science techniques, we extract meaningful patterns to help businesses optimize their sales strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from a Black Friday sales dataset, containing customer demographics, purchase behavior, and product information. The data includes:
- User ID
- Product ID
- Age, Gender, City Category
- Product Category
- Purchase Amount

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify key factors influencing purchase behavior
- Visualize data trends
- Apply machine learning techniques for predictive modeling

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Data Visualization** (matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (scikit-learn)
